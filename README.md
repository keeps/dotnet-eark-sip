A .NET library and CLI tool for creating E-ARK Submission Information Packages (SIPs).

Providing support for E-ARK SIP formats (2.0.4, 2.1.0, 2.2.0), this project makes it easier to create and manage valid SIPs for long-term digital preservation using the E-ARK standards.

## Introduction

This repository provides a command-line interface (CLI) and a .NET library to create E-ARK Submission Information Packages **version 2.2.0**.

The _E-ARK Information Package_ specifications are maintained by the [DILCIS Board](http://www.dilcis.eu/). The DILCIS Board is an international group of experts dedicated to developing and maintaining interoperability specifications for the long-term preservation of digital content.

These specifications have been sponsored and are promoted by the European Commission under the [eArchiving Initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/earchiving).

## Why .NET E-ARK SIP?

- **Automation**: Easily script and automate the creation of E-ARK SIPs.
- **Integration**: Embed this library into your applications to implement powerful export and transfer processes between business applications and digital archives (OAIS). The library is open-source, but not viral!
- **Standards-Compliant**: Ensures compliance with DILCIS Board specifications.
- **CLI & Library**: Use it stand-alone or integrate into your .NET projects.
- **Improvise, adapt, overcome**: You are free to modify and enhance this library to meet your needs. Just remember, forks must be open source as well.

## Features

- **CLI Tool**: Easily create SIPs via a command-line interface.
- **.NET Library**: Integrate with your own projects by referencing the NuGet package or local DLL.
- **Checksums**: Automatic creates checksums (SHA-256 by default) for SIP files.
- **Multiple metadata files**: Add descriptive and preservation metadata, including external schemas.
- **Documentation**: Bundle documentation files within your SIP to better describe the contents of the submission.
- **Configurability**: Override default schemas, specify representation types, set custom IDs, and more.

## Requirements

- .NET Standard 2.0 (or higher)
- Windows, Linux, or macOS

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/keeps/dotnet-eark-sip/releases/latest) to use as a standalone CLI tool, or reference it in your .NET project.

## Usage

You can use the **dotnet-eark-sip** as a **command-line tool** or as a **.NET library** (by referencing it in your project).

### Use as a Command-line Tool

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/keeps/dotnet-eark-sip/releases/latest).
2. Unzip or place the tool in a directory of your choice.
3. Run the following command (adjusting paths accordingly):

```bash
dotnet-eark-sip create
```

#### Available options

- **create**: Creates an E-ARK SIP (this is the default action, so it can be omitted).
- **-d, --documentation**: Path(s) to folder(s)/file(s) to add to the SIP’s documentation section.
- **-p, --path**: Path to save the SIP.
- **-a, --ancestors**: ID(s) of the SIP’s ancestors.
- **-C, --checksum**: Checksum algorithm (default is SHA-256).
- **-T, --target-only**: Adds only the files for the representations.
- **-v, --version**: E-ARK SIP specification version (default: 2.1.0).
- **--submitter-name**: The name of the submitter agent.
- **--submitter-id**: The identification code of the submitter agent.
- **--sip-id**: ID of the SIP.
- **--override-schema**: Overrides default schema.
- **-s, --strategy**: Write strategy (default: Zip).

**Descriptive Metadata Options**

- **--metadata-files**: Path(s) to metadata file(s), comma-separated. _Required if_ `--representation-data-lists` _is not set_.
- **--metadata-types**: Metadata type(s), comma-separated. _Required if_ `--metadata-files` _is set_.
- **--metadata-schemas**: Path(s) to metadata schema file(s), comma-separated.
- **--metadata-versions**: Metadata version(s), comma-separated.

**Representation Options**

- **--representation-data-lists**: Path(s) to file(s) for representation, comma-separated. _Required if_ `--metadata-files` _is not set_.
- **--representation-id**: Representation identifier(s), comma-separated. Defaults to `rep<number>` if not provided.
- **--representation-type**: Representation type(s), comma-separated.

#### Example

```bash
dotnet-eark-sip create --metadata-files metadata.xml --metadata-types ead --metadata-schemas ead2002.xsd \
--representation-data-lists dataFile1.pdf,dataFolder1,dataFile2.png \
--sip-id sip1 --ancestors sip2,sip3 --documentation documentation1,documentationFolder \
--path outputFolder --submitter-name agent1 --submitter-id 123
```

### Use as a .NET Library

> **Note**: If you do not plan to use this as a .NET library, you can skip this section.

1. Install the package via NuGet:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package dotnet-eark-sip
   ```
2. Use it in your C# code:

#### Example

```csharp
// Import dependencies
using IP;
using Mets;

// Start creating a SIP
SIP sip = new EARKSIP("SIP_1", IPContentType.GetMIXED(), IPContentInformationType.GetMIXED(), "2.1.0");

// Set the name of the software that is creating the SIP (mandatory)
sip.AddCreatorSoftwareAgent("KEEPS .NET E-ARK SIP", "1.0.0");

// Set optional human-readable description
sip.SetDescription("A full E-ARK SIP");

// Add descriptive metadata (SIP level)
IPDescriptiveMetadata descriptiveMetadata = new(
    new IPFile(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), ".\\Resources\\EARK\\metadata_descriptive_dc.xml")),
    new MetadataType(IMetadataMdtype.DC),
    null
);
sip.AddDescriptiveMetadata(descriptiveMetadata);

// Add xml schema (SIP level)
sip.AddSchema(new IPFile(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), ".\\Resources\\EARK\\schema.xsd")));


// Add a representation (status will be set to the default value, i.e. ORIGINAL)
IPRepresentation representation1 = new("representation 1");
sip.AddRepresentation(representation1);

// Add a file to the representation
IPFile representationFile = new(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), ".\\Resources\\EARK\\documentation.pdf"));
representationFile.SetRenameTo("data_.pdf");
representation1.AddFile(representationFile);

// Build the SIP
ZipWriteStrategyFactory zipWriteStrategyFactory = new();
IWriteStrategy writeStrategy = zipWriteStrategyFactory.Create(outputPath);
string zipSIP = sip.Build(writeStrategy);

```
